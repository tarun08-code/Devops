# Networking Fundamentals - Summary Notes

## 1. IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)

**Purpose**: Provides a unique identification number to each device connected to a network

**Why needed?**
- Track device activities
- Block/allow access to specific devices
- Monitor network usage
- Essential for device communication

**IPv4 Standard**:
- Format: `192.168.12.4` (four numbers separated by dots)
- Each number ranges from **0 to 255**
- Total: **4 bytes = 32 bits**
- Each byte = 8 bits

**Binary Representation**:
- Computers understand IP addresses in binary (bits)
- Example: 192 = `11000000` in binary
- Maximum value per byte: 255 (all bits set to 1)

## 2. Subnet (Sub-networking)

**Purpose**: Divide a large network into smaller, isolated networks

**Key Benefits**:
- **Security**: Isolate sensitive data
- **Privacy**: Separate different user groups
- **Isolation**: Prevent network-wide breaches

**Types of Subnets**:
1. **Private Subnet**: No internet access
2. **Public Subnet**: Has internet access (via Internet Gateway)

**Common Private IP Ranges**:
- `192.x.x.x`
- `172.x.x.x`
- `10.x.x.x`

---

## 3. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

**Purpose**: Define how many IP addresses are available in a subnet

**Format**: `192.168.3.0/24`

**Calculation Formula**:
```
Number of IPs = 2^(32 - CIDR number)
```

**Common Examples**:
| CIDR | Calculation | Number of IPs |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| /24 | 2^(32-24) = 2^8 | 256 |
| /16 | 2^(32-16) = 2^16 | 65,536 |
| /8 | 2^(32-8) = 2^24 | 16,777,216 |
| /27 | 2^(32-27) = 2^5 | 32 |
| /31 | 2^(32-31) = 2^1 | 2 |

**Class Types**:
- **Class A**: /8
- **Class B**: /16
- **Class C**: /24

## 4. Ports

**Purpose**: Unique identifier for applications running on a device

**Key Points**:
- Multiple applications can run on one virtual machine
- Each application needs a unique port number
- Access format: `IP_Address:Port` (e.g., `3.4.5.8:9191`)

**Common Reserved Ports**:
- Port 80: HTTP
- Port 443: HTTPS
- Port 3306: MySQL
- Port 8080: Jenkins

**Best Practice**: Use unique ports like 9000, 9191, 5162 for custom applications

---

## Practice Assignments

1. Convert IP `172.32.16.1` to binary format
2. Calculate IPs for CIDR: `172.68.3.0/30`
3. Find CIDR for `10.0.0.0/8`

## Next Topic
**OSI Model** (covered in Part 2) - will include HTTP, TCP, and network layers 1-7

# **🌐 OSI Model — Short & Powerful Summary**

The **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)** is a **7-layer framework** that explains **how data moves through a network**. Each layer has its own job, and data passes through these layers when sending or receiving anything online.

---

# **🔥 The 7 Layers (Simple Breakdown)**

### **1️⃣ Physical Layer**

* Deals with **cables, signals, bits (0/1)**
* Sends raw data physically
* Devices: hubs, cables, modems

### **2️⃣ Data Link Layer**

* Ensures **error-free** delivery between two directly-connected devices
* Uses **MAC addresses**
* Creates **frames**
* Devices: switches

### **3️⃣ Network Layer**

* Handles **IP addresses**
* Performs **routing** (best path to destination)
* Data unit: **packets**
* Devices: routers

### **4️⃣ Transport Layer**

* **End-to-end delivery**
* Splits data into **segments**
* Uses **ports** (like port 80, 443)
* TCP = reliable, UDP = fast but no guarantee

### **5️⃣ Session Layer**

* Creates and manages **sessions**
* Controls who talks when
* Adds **checkpoints**

### **6️⃣ Presentation Layer**

* **Formats, encrypts, compresses** data
* Converts data into a readable format
* Supports TLS/SSL, JPEG, GIF

### **7️⃣ Application Layer**

* Layer closest to users
* Apps like **HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP** work here
* Provides interfaces for email, browsing, file transfer

---

# **📦 How Data Travels (Quick Flow)**

### **Sender:**

App ➝ Presentation ➝ Session ➝ Transport ➝ Network ➝ Data Link ➝ Physical

### **Receiver:**

Physical ➝ Data Link ➝ Network ➝ Transport ➝ Session ➝ Presentation ➝ Application

Each layer adds its own info → sends → receiver removes info → shows original data.

---

# **🆚 OSI vs TCP/IP (Easy)**

* **OSI** = 7 layers (theory)
* **TCP/IP** = 4 layers (real Internet model)
* Application + Presentation + Session → merged in TCP/IP
* Physical + Data Link → merged in TCP/IP

---

# **🙏 Why OSI Matters**

* Makes troubleshooting easier
* Standardizes communication
* Helps understand network flow
* Great for interviews

---

# **📧 Real-Life Example: Sending Email**

* App layer: typing email
* Presentation: encryption
* Session: connection opens
* Transport: breaks into segments + ports
* Network: adds IP + routing
* Data Link: MAC + frames
* Physical: sends as signals

Receiver reverses this process.

8 bits = 4 bytes thats y ip add are like this 

162.43.54.3  this has 4 bytes and each byte contains 8 bits 

maximum bits can be 255 and this cant be changed this is ip v4 standards 

so its 2 power 255 which is 

✅ IPv4 = 32 bits

1 byte = 8 bits

4 bytes → 4 × 8 = 32 bits

So total possible IPv4 addresses = 2³² = 4,294,967,296 (around 4.3 billion).

this is not enough so we decided to use ipv6 version 6 in this 

IPv6 uses 128 bits →
Total addresses = 2¹²⁸ ≈ 340 undecillion

8 blocks × 16 bits = 128 bits

IPv6 = 128 bits
= 8 sections
= each section 16 bits
= written in hex for convenience.

eg - 
IPv4 = 4 blocks
Example: 192.168.0.1

IPv6 = 8 blocks
Example: 2401:abcd:ef01:2345:6789:abcd:ef12:3456

subnet -----------------------------
part of bigger network and its separate and secure 

public subnet - which has access to the internet 
private subnet - which does not have access to the internet   
 
question 1 - lets say u want 256 ip for ur business needs now how do u get that in a subnet ?

main ip range given is this 172.32.45.0 to 172.32.0.0 

so now u want 256 ips u can just keep the first 3 bytes same and just use the last byte for 256 ip 

eg : 172.32.45.0/24
		172.32.45.1/24
		172.32.45.2/24
		172.32.45.3/24
		.
		.
		.
		till 172.32.45.255 so including the 0 its 256 ips 

simple when asked how we can specify how many ips this is how we can do 

so y do we even pu /24 cuz we are not using the remaining 24 bits lets say ip is like this 

8bits | 8bits | 8bits | 8bits | = 32 

since inside the subnet ur not using the first 3 bytes so its 24 bits thats y u put 24 in the end and now 

32-24 = 8 so u do 2 power 8 which is 256 ips simple :) so this is called CIDR Range
