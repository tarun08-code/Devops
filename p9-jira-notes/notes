# Summary Notes: JIRA & Agile Project Management for DevOps Teams

## Key Concepts

### What is JIRA?
- **Project management tool** used to track work, bugs, and user stories
- Organizations have multiple projects (e.g., payments, transactions, orders, infrastructure)
- DevOps typically has a **centralized project** where any team can create requests

### Core JIRA Components

#### 1. **Backlog**
- Collection of incoming tickets (user stories, bugs, features)
- No deadlines or estimations initially
- Acts as a "pile" of requests waiting to be prioritized

#### 2. **Sprint**
- **Time-boxed period** (typically 2-4 weeks, commonly 3 weeks)
- Team commits to delivering specific stories within this timeframe
- Only pick what can realistically be delivered

#### 3. **Story Points (Fibonacci Series)**
- **1** = Very small/simple task
- **2** = Small
- **3** = Medium
- **5** = Large
- **8** = Extra large
- **13** = Super complex
- Based on complexity, time, and effort required

## Agile Ceremonies

### 1. **Backlog Grooming/Refinement**
- Product owner prioritizes stories from top to bottom
- Team discusses top priority items
- Stories are sized using Fibonacci series
- Refined stories moved to sprint or "backlog refinement" section

### 2. **Sprint Planning**
- **Capacity planning**: Determine team availability for the sprint
- Calculate total story points team can handle
- Pull prioritized stories into the sprint
- Set **Sprint Goal** (e.g., "Fix all issues with existing CI/CD pipelines")

### 3. **Daily Stand-up** (15 minutes max)
- Three key questions:
  1. What did you do yesterday?
  2. What will you do today?
  3. Any blockers?
- **Facilitated by Scrum Master** initially
- Mature teams can self-organize

### 4. **Mid-Sprint Review** (30-45 minutes)
- Check progress halfway through sprint
- Identify if team is on track
- Address hard blockers or re-estimation needs

### 5. **Sprint Retrospective**
- Review what went well and what didn't
- Discuss estimation accuracy
- Continuous improvement focus

## JIRA Board Views

### Active Sprint Tab
- Shows **current work in progress**
- Columns: To Do → In Progress → Code Review → Done
- Provides real-time status visibility for managers

### Reports
- **Sprint Report**: Committed vs. completed stories
- **Velocity Chart**: Team's delivery trend over multiple sprints
- **Burndown/Burnup Charts**: Progress visualization

## For New Team Members

### Onboarding Approach
- Start with **small, straightforward tickets** (1-2 story points)
- Pair with experienced developers using **sub-tasks**
- Don't expect accurate estimation initially (2-3 sprints learning curve)
- Team takes average when estimates differ

### Estimation Discussions
- If estimates vary (e.g., 3 vs 5 points), team discusses and averages
- Learning happens through actual work experience

## Additional JIRA Features

### Dashboards
- Create custom views with queries
- Filter by team, issue type, status
- Visualize data with pie charts and graphs
- Useful for management reporting

### Confluence Integration
- **Document storage** linked to JIRA
- Store KT documents, meeting notes, workflows
- Root cause analysis documentation
- Replaces traditional folder structures

### Release Management
- Track what gets released in each sprint
- Version tracking (especially for development teams)
- DevOps can use for 3-month/6-month planning

## Key Terminology

- **Issue**: Any ticket in JIRA (story, bug, task, etc.)
- **Epic/Feature**: Large body of work broken into stories
- **Velocity**: Team's average delivery capacity over time
- **Spillover**: Stories not completed in a sprint

## Best Practices

✅ Only commit to what can be delivered in the sprint  
✅ Keep daily stand-ups under 15 minutes  
✅ Conduct mid-sprint reviews for course correction  
✅ Use sub-tasks for knowledge transfer  
✅ Link documentation in Confluence  
✅ Track velocity to improve planning accuracy
