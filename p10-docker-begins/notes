we have done a small docker project just a little one 

first we have launched a ec2 and in that we downloaded the docker io 

now we checked if the docker demon is running or not 

and then we created a docker file in that we have written some commmads to run our simple python program 

then we just did build command 

docker build -t abhishekf5/my-first-docker-image:latest .

then the images got created and then we ran it too 

docker run -it abhishekf5/my-first-docker-image

after that we pushed the image to the docker hub 

docker push abhishekf5/my-first-docker-image
