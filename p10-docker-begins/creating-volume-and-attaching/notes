so in this project we are going to create a volume and attach it to a image and run the container 

CRETAING VOLUMES 
* docker volume create volume_name
* docker volume ls 
* docker volume inspect volume_name   -- detailed things 
* docker volume rm volume_name 

CREATING IMAGE 
*docker build -t image_name docker_file
*docker build -t image_name .             -- if ur in the same folder use . or else file name like above

now is the main course - how to attach the volume with image 
* you cerate a volume and image and then run this command 

docker run -d --mount source=volume_name, target=/app, image_name

*docker ps -- to know which constainer is running
