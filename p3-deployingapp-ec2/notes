🚀 Deploying a Frontend App on AWS EC2 (DevOps Beginner Project)

This project demonstrates how I deployed a simple frontend application (built using Vite/Node) onto an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance.
The goal was to understand real server hosting, networking, security groups, and how to expose a local development server publicly.

🛠️ Tech & Tools Used

AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 22.04)

Vite (Frontend Dev Server)

Node.js & npm

SSH

Security Groups (AWS)

Ubuntu Terminal

PowerShell / CMD for testing from local machine

📌 What This Project Covers

Launching an EC2 instance

Connecting via SSH

Installing Node.js

Running a Vite app on EC2

Opening custom ports (5173)

Binding the dev server to an external host

Testing external connectivity

Deploying your first live app

🔥 Steps I Followed

1. Launched an AWS EC2 Instance

Selected Ubuntu 22.04

Chose t2.micro (Free Tier)

Created / downloaded key pair

Connected using:

ssh -i mykey.pem ubuntu@<public-ip>

2. Installed Node.js & npm
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nodejs npm -y
   node -v
   npm -v

3. Cloned / Copied My Project Into EC2
   cd ~
   git clone <my-repo>
   cd <project-folder>
   npm install

4. Opened Custom Ports in AWS

Went to EC2 → Security Groups → Inbound Rules and added:

Type Port Source
Custom TCP 5173 0.0.0.0/0
Custom TCP 5174 0.0.0.0/0

This allows the app to be accessible publicly.

5. Ran Vite on External Host

Vite by default runs on localhost, meaning nobody can access it from the outside.

So I started it with:

npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173

Vite output:

Local: http://localhost:5173/
Network: http://172.31.xx.xx:5173/

This means Vite is now listening on the instance’s network interface.

6. Verified the Server is Listening

On EC2:

sudo ss -ltnp | grep 5173

Expected output:

LISTEN ... 0.0.0.0:5173 ... node

7. Tested Connection From My Local Machine

On Windows PowerShell:

Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <public-ip> -Port 5173

Result:

TcpTestSucceeded : True

That confirmed the port is open and reachable globally.

8. Accessed My Live App

Finally opened:

👉 http://<EC2-public-ip>:5173

And boom — my app was LIVE on the internet 🎉
This was officially my first ever cloud-hosted web app.

What “host binding” actually means (--host 0.0.0.0)

How to troubleshoot ports, networking, and firewalls

How to check if a port is listening using Linux tools

How to test connectivity from Windows using PowerShell
