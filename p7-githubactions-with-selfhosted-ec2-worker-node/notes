what are we doing in this project mini one ofc 

so we are using ec2 instance as working node for github actions process 

u may ask y , i mean y not if u have security concers u can use it or if u have some large testing u can use the self hosted nodes for large processing things 

now create a new ec2 instance and allow 
* inbound and outbound trafffic fot both 
 HTTP AND HTTPS in security groups 


 now after doing that ther will be set of commands to run in ec2 run that this will do the job

 now in the yml file put runns-on as self-hosted 

 now our self hosted is our ec2
